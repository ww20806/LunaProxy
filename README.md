## LunaProxy Reviews

LunaProxy has received mixed reviews from users across multiple platforms, with an overall rating of 3.4 stars on TrustPilot based on 69 reviews. Approximately 52% of users gave 5-star ratings, praising the platform's extensive features, competitive pricing, and responsive technical support. Positive feedback highlights LunaProxy's wide range of proxy protocols, simple and intuitive interface, stable long-term performance, and excellent value for money at $0.77/GB. Users particularly appreciate the 200M+ IP pool coverage across 195 countries, high success rates, and the ability to handle multiple concurrent connections without bandwidth limitations. One verified user on Slashdot stated: "LunaProxy is the most efficient proxy I've ever used. Overall, LunaProxy is an excellent proxy software with powerful features, easy operation and stable performance".

However, 44% of reviews were 1-star ratings, with common complaints including slow connection speeds (below 1 Mbps in some cases), inconsistent customer support response times ranging from 48 hours to no response at all, and refund processing issues. Some users reported difficulties with proxy compatibility and occasional concerns about datacenter proxies being misrepresented as residential proxies. A critical review on TrustPilot noted: "Despite meeting all their refund criteria, support ignored my request... It's now August and I still haven't received a resolution or refund". The platform scores better on other metrics, with users acknowledging the clean interface suitable for beginners, reliable uptime for most use cases, and adequate performance for web scraping and data collection tasks.
